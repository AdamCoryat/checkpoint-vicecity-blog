I created this application for a place to create blogs and post that you want to share with other people about the amazing game Grand Theft Auto Vice City. 

This Application was created with a Vue2 client side.

- When you create a user you can see all the blogs that are posted on the landing page.
- You can select a blog to open it up in a details page to view more about the blog.
- You can comment on other users blogs
- You can navaigate to the blog tab on the top of the page to create a blog. 
- After you create your blog you can edit or delete it. 
- When you navigate to your profile tab you can view your stats (how many posts and comments you have) 
- When in the profile page you can view what comments and blogs you have created. Selecting these will navigate you to that page.
